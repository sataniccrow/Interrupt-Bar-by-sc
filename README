This is a modified version of the popular addon knowns as "Interrupt Bar" made by the also well known Kollective.
I've added a little refactoring (I'm planning to work a little bit more on that) and some more spells, which a pvper will be glad to be able to check.
Now it's even possible to select the number of items per line by using a cmd shortcut

This addon is completly compatible with the original versione and it WILL NOT OVERWRITE your personal settings

Command shortcuts:
/ibsc  -- show options
/ibsc scale -- scale the interface
/ibsc itemPerLine -- set the number of spells'frame per line -- IT NEEDS A RELOAD to be fully effective
/ibsc lock -- lock/unlock the addon's frame
/ibsc hidden -- hide/show the addon
/ibsc test -- test the addon
/ibsc reset -- reset the default values
